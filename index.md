### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

Lab 9, part 2 was my favorite because I learned how word processors and social media can check spelling. I wrote a program to scan the file document to find misspelled words, by using a dictionary file to check. When I tested the program, I was able to see the results of the misspelled words which was really amazing.

* Lab 12

Lab 12, part 2 was my favorite because I learned about the different types of random number generators. Instead of using rand() or strand(), I used RandomNumberGenerator to create a PRNG which will generate doubles within ranges. The RandomNumberGenerator class is useful because I’m able to generate more unpredictable numbers.

* Lab 10

Lab 10, part 2 was my favorite because I learned how to use 2D vectors to hold 2 lists of information. I needed to create a 2D data structure to organize California’s population data by county. At first, I struggled to understand 2D vectors, but once I understood how to work I was able to fix my program to make it run correctly.
